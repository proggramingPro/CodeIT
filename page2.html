        <h3 class="c11">Start with C Hello World Program</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
        To begin with, the “Hello World” program is the first step towards learning any programming language
        and also one of the simplest programs you will learn. All one needs to do is display the message “Hello World”
        on the screen. Let’s look at the program and try to understand the terminologies involved in it.
        </pre>
        <h3 class="c13">C Program to Print “Hello World”</h3>
        <p class="c90">The following C program displays “Hello World” in the output</p>
        <div class="c14">
            <pre class="c15">
              // Simple C program to display "Hello World"

              // Header file for input output functions
              #include< stdio.h>

              // main function -
              // where the execution of program begins
              int main()
              {
                //print Hello World
                printf("Hello World");

                return 0;
              }
            </pre>
        </div>
        <h3 class="c13">OUTPUT</h3>
        <div id="c16">
            <h4 id="c17">Hello World</h4>
        </div>
        <h3 class="c13">Variables</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
            A Variable is a container which store a 'value'. In kitchen ,we have container storing Rice , Dal,sugar etc. 
            similar to that Variable in C stores values of a constant 
            Example: 
                     a=3;   //a is assigned "3"
                     b=4.7;  //b os assigned "4.7"
                     c='A';  //c is assigned "A"
        </pre>
        <h3 class="c13">Rules for naming variable in C</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
            1. First character must be alphabet or underscore(_)
            2. No commas,blank allowed
            3. No special symbol other than (_) allowed
            4. Veriable name are case sensitive
              
            We must creat meaningful variable name in our program. This enhances readability of our programs.
        </pre>
        <h3 class="c13">Constants</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
            An entity whose value doesn't change is called as a Constant.
            A variable is entity whose value can be changed.
        </pre>
        <h3 class="c13">Type of constant</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
            primerily,there are three type of constant.
            1. Integer constant : -1,2,5,6
            2. Float constant : 1.1,23.4,7.0
            3. character constant : 'a','$','@'
        </pre>
        <h3 class="c13">Keyword</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
            These are reserved words, whose remaning is alredy known to the cmpiler . these are 32
            keywords available in C.
              auto ,   double , int   ,    sturct   ,   break ,   long  ,   else  ,  switch
              case  ,  return, enum   ,  typedef  ,  char  ,   register ,  extern ,  union
              const ,   short  , float  ,   unsigned  ,  continue , signed  ,  for  ,  void 
              default , goto  ,  volatile , do   ,   static  ,  if  ,   while
        </pre>
        <h3 class="c13">Basic structure of C program.</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
            all C programs have to follow a basic stucture . A C program status with a main function and exerted instuction
            present inside it. Each instruction is terminated with a semicolon(;)

            There are some rules which are applicable to all the C program :
            1. Every program execution starts from main() function.
            2. All the statements are terminated with a semicolon.
            3. Instruction are case-sensitive
            4. Instructions are executed in the same order in which they are written.
        </pre>
        <h3 class="c13">Comments</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
            comments are use to clarity someting about the program in plain language . it is a way for us to add toles to our program.
            there are two type of comments in C.

            1. Single line Comment : // this is a comments
            2. multi- line Comment : /* this is a multi line comments */

            comments in a C program are not executed and are ignored.
        </pre>
        <h3 class="c13">Compilation and Execution</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
            A compiler is a computer program hich constuct a Cprogram into machine language so that it can be 
            easily understand by the computer.
            A C program is written in plain text. this text is combination of instruction in particular sequence . 
            the compiler perform some basic checks and finally convert the program into an executive.  
        </pre>
        <h3 class="c13">Library Function</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
            C language has a lot of valuable library function which is used to carry out certain tasks. 
            for instance printf function is used to print values on the screen.
            
            printf("This is %d",i);

            %d for Integer
            %f for float values
            %c for character  
        </pre>
        <h3 class="c13">Type of variable</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
            1.  Integer variable : int a = 3;
            2.  Float veriable : int a = 3.4;
            3.  Character veriable : char a = 'B';
        </pre>
        <h3 class="c13">Receiving input from the user</h3>
        <pre class="c12">
            In order to take input from the user and assigned it to a variable , we use scanf function . 

            Syntax for using scanf:
              scanf("%d",&i);

            & is the " address of " operator and it means that the supplied value should be 
            copied to the  address which is indicated by variable i.
