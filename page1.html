    <h1 class="c1">Let Start C</h1>
    <pre class="c2">
        In this C Tutorial, you’ll learn all C programming basic to advanced concepts like variables, arrays,
        pointers, strings, loops, etc. This C Programming Tutorial is designed for both beginners as well as
        experienced professionals, who’re looking to learn and enhance their knowledge of the C programming
        language.

    <h2 class="c3">What is C?</h2>
    <pre class="c4">
        C is a general-purpose, procedural, high-level programming language used in the development of
        computer software and applications, system programming, games, and more.

            1. C language was developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1972.
            2. It is a powerful and flexible language which was first developed for the programming of the 
               UNIX operating System.
            3. C is one of the most widely used programming languages.

        C programming language is known for its simplicity and efficiency. It is the best choice to start with
        programming as it gives you a foundational understanding of programming.
    </pre>
    <h3 class="c6">
        The main features of the C language include:
    </h3>
    <pre class="c7">
        1. General Purpose and portable
        2. Low-level Memory Access
        3. Fast speed and Clean Syntax
    </pre>
    <h3 class="c8">Why Should We Learn C?</h3>
    <pre class="c9">
        Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax 
        of java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset 
        of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

        So,  if a person learns C programming first, it will help him to learn any modern programming language as well.
        As learning C help to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system.
        Like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.

    <h3 class="c8">Difference Between C and C++</h3>
    <pre class="c9">
        C++ was created to add the OOPs concept into C language so they both have very similar syntax 
        but both are a bit different from each other.Following are some main differences between C and C++ 
        Programming language.

        1.C++ supports OOPs paradigm while C only have procedural concept of programming.
        2.C++ have exception handling capablities. In C, we have to resolve manually.
        3.There are no references in C.

        There are many more differences between C and C++ but these are sufficient at this point.

    <h3 class="c8">Features of C Programming Language</h3>
    <pre class="c9">
        1.Procedural Language
        2.Fast and Efficient
        3.Modularity
        4.Statically Type
        5.General-Purpose Language
        6.Rich set of built-in Operators
        7.Libraries with Rich Functions
        8.Middle-Level Language
        9.Portability
        10.Easy to Extend
